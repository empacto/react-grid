- Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
- Manipulating & testing values
- Creating composite functions



# 1.  Lodash installation:

- Ctrl + ' => terminal shell : 


```sh
npm i lodash@4.17.1

```sh
import React, { Component } from 'react';

const Pagination = props => {

 const {itemsCount, pageSize} = props;

 const pagesCount = itemsCount / pageSize;
const pages = _.range(1,pagesCount + 1);

```
